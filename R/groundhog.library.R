#' Install packages as available on set date -  groundhog.library()
#'
#'@param pkg character string with name of target package to load (and install if needed), 
#'need not be in quotes.
#'@param date character string  (yyyy-mm-dd), or date value, with the date which determines the 
#'version of the package, and all dependencies, to be loaded (and installed if needed).
#'@param quiet.install logical, defaults to `TRUE`. When set to `FALSE`, displays
#'  output generated by `install.packages()` when installing from source
#'@param include.suggests logical, defaults to `FALSE`. When set to `TRUE`, installs/
#'  loads dependencies classified in the DESCRIPTION file as `suggested`.
#'@param ignore.deps an optional character vector containing dependencies which 
#'   may be already loaded in the R session and even if the loaded version does not match
#'   the version implied by the entered date, groundhog.library() will proceed and ignore 
#'   this conflict. If one version of a package is loaded, and a different is needed for
#'   groundhog, the default behavior is to stop the request and ask the user to restart
#'   the R session to unload all packages. This will bypass that requirement.
#'@param force.source logical (defaults to `FALSE`). When set to `TRUE`, will not attempt 
#'   installing binary from CRAN or MRAN and instead download source file and install it.
#'@param force.install logical (defaults to `FALSE`). When set to `TRUE`, will delete  
#'   existing package files in groundhog folder, and install anew.
#'@return a character vector containing all active packages for the session,
#'   with their version number, under the format `pkg_vrs`.
