\title{Install packages as available on set date -  groundhog.library()}
\usage{
groundhog.library(
  pkg,
  date,
  quiet.install = TRUE,
  include.suggests = FALSE,
  ignore.deps = c(),
  force.source = FALSE,
  force.install = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{pkg}{character string or vector with name of target package(s) to load (and install if needed),
need not be in quotes.}

\item{date}{character string  (yyyy-mm-dd), or date value, with the date which determines the
version of the package, and all dependencies, to be loaded (and installed if needed).}

\item{quiet.install}{logical, defaults to \code{TRUE}. When set to \code{FALSE}, displays
output generated by \code{install.packages()} when installing from source}

\item{include.suggests}{logical, defaults to \code{FALSE}. When set to \code{TRUE}, installs/
loads dependencies classified in the DESCRIPTION file as \code{suggested}.}

\item{ignore.deps}{an optional character vector containing dependencies which
may be already loaded in the R session and even if the loaded version does not match
the version implied by the entered date, groundhog.library() will proceed and ignore
this conflict. If one version of a package is loaded, and a different is needed for
groundhog, the default behavior is to stop the request and ask the user to restart
the R session to unload all packages. This will bypass that requirement.}

\item{force.source}{logical (defaults to \code{FALSE}). When set to \code{TRUE}, will not attempt
installing binary from CRAN or MRAN and instead download source file and install it.}

\item{force.install}{logical (defaults to \code{FALSE}). When set to \code{TRUE}, will delete
existing package files in groundhog folder, and install anew.}
}
\value{
a character vector containing all active packages for the session,
with their version number, under the format \code{pkg_vrs}.
